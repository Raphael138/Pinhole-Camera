# Pinhole-Camera
This project aims to model a simple pinhole camera and depth sensor. In other words, given a 3D point cloud, the goal is to project the points onto a 2D plane and visualize the distance from the imaginary camera to the each point. This code was part of my midterm project for ECE 4240: Robot Perception.

Much of the cell outputs are sliders and use interactive widgets and thus the web browser doesn't display properly the notebook.
